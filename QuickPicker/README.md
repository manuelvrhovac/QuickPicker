## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. To integrate QuickPicker into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'QuickPicker', '~> 0.9.0'
end
```

Then run `pod install` command inside Terminal.



### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate QuickPicker into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "manuelvrhovac/QuickPicker" ~> 0.9.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `QuickPicker.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate QuickPicker into your project manually.
